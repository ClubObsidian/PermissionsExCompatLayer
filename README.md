# PermissionsExCompatLayer

A compatability layer for PermissionsEx to LuckPerms. 
Written out of necessity of having 5 year old infastructure that relies on PermissionsEx. 
All methods will be implemented to make the plugin compatible with plugins such as Vault and EssentialsX.
If you need anything else that is not implemented make a pull request or fork.
